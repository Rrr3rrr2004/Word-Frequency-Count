renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, offer a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and have the potential to mitigate climate change and reduce reliance on non-renewable resources. solar energy harnesses the power of sunlight through photovoltaic cells, while wind energy uses turbines to capture the kinetic energy of the wind. hydropower generates electricity from flowing water, often through dams or turbines. transitioning to renewable energy sources is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting energy independence, and creating a more resilient and sustainable energy system.
